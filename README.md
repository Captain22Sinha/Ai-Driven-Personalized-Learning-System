🌟 AI-Driven Personalized Learning System

Intelligent. Adaptive. Learner-Centric.

Reimagining education with the power of Artificial Intelligence.
This system dynamically analyzes learning behavior, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and creates personalized learning paths to help every learner reach their highest potential.

✨ Empowering personalized learning through AI-driven insights ✨

🚀 Vision

Education should never be one-size-fits-all.
This project aims to build an adaptive, intelligent, and deeply personalized learning ecosystem where:

Performance insights guide the learning process

Dynamic learning paths evolve with the learner

AI models personalize content in real time

The goal is mastery, not memorization

🔥 Key Highlights

Personalized Learning Engine
Learner’s performance, activity, and pace are analyzed to deliver personalized content.

AI-Powered Recommendation System
Recommends study topics, difficulty levels, and resources based on progress.

Progress Analytics Dashboard
Visual insights to help learners understand their strengths and improvement areas.

Adaptive Assessments
Quiz difficulty evolves based on the learner’s responses.

Modular & Scalable Architecture
Designed for easy updates, improvements, and model integration.
