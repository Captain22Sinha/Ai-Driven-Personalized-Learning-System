🤖 AI models tailor content in real-time

🎯 Motivation and mastery replace rote learning

A step toward the future of AI-powered self-paced education.

🔥 Key Highlights
🎓 1. Personalized Learning Engine

Analyzes user progress, quiz scores, learning patterns, and suggests tailored lessons.

🧠 2. AI-Powered Recommendation System

Recommends study materials, topics, and difficulty levels aligned with the learner’s profile.

📈 3. Progress Dashboards

Visual insights help identify strengths, weaknesses, and growth trends.

🤓 4. Adaptive Assessments

Quizzes evolve based on performance, adjusting difficulty automatically.

🔧 5. Modular & Scalable Architecture

Clean structure for easy expansion, ML model upgrades, and new features.
